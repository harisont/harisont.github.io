My sambo and I have a thing for tiny board games and really love the design of [Oink games](https://oinkgames.com/). We recently bought [In a Grove](https://oinkgames.com/en/games/analog/in-a-grove/) but weren't quite satisfied with the rules. Unlike with [The Pyramid's Deadline](https://oinkgames.com/en/games/analog/the-pyramids-deadline/), a case where e decided to [improve the rules](https://observablehq.com/@kappanneo/tpd?collection=@kappanneo/boardgames), in this case we decided to re-invent the game all over again, together with our friend Cornelia.

Enjoy!

<!--TODO: score tokens-->

## Game objective
Each player is a mujer, whose goal is to be the first one to obtain the favour of all five Mustached Mexican Men: Alberto, Bernardo, Carlos, David and Enrique.
However, if two or more mujeres achieve this simultaneously, they have to start over _again_.

## Setup
The game is played in turns, clockwise. 

Decide which player should start the first round, for example by spinning the __first player token__.
The first player gets a __maniquí__; the second player gets the other __maniquí__ and the __molestia__.

Deal one __mujer__ face-down to each player, ignoring the remaining ones (do not reveal them). 

## How to play
At each round, the objective is to obtain the favor of one MMM by placing you __mujer__ in a winning pile - one of the longest ones. 

When it is their turn, each player either creates a new pile or places their __mujer__ on an existing pile.
Starting from the second player, after creating or growing a pile, each player can place or move the __molestia__ on the top or on the bottom of a pile. The pile cannot grow in that direction.

### Creating new pile
Usually, piles are initiated with a __MMM token__, a __maniquí__, a __mujer__.
When a player does so, they choose the MMM they are competing for and place the corresponding token on the table on top of the __maniquí__ (if you are playing with cards, keep in mind that the card representing the __MMM token__ only acts as a marker and as such is not part of the pile). They then decide what the value of the __maniquí__ will be (either 1 or 9) and place the __mujer__ in the pile so that is in ascending order.

The only exception to this is initialization with a 5 (a colored person tile if you have the original set or a red card if you're playing with Poker cards), which requires an __MMM token__ but not a __maniquí__.
In this case, the __MMM token__ is placed directly on the __mujer__. 

If a player who has a __maniquí__ decides not to use it, they to have to hand it over to the next player.

### Growing piles
In order to grow a pile, cards can be placed either on the top or on the bottom of an existing one, provided that they preserve its numerical, ascending order. Beteween two subsequent cards there can be a gap. Remember, however, that a pile cannot grow in the direction of a __molestia__. 

### End of the round
A round ends when the last __mujer__ has been placed. 
At this point, players with __mujeres__ on a winning pile obtain the favour of an MMM, thus scoring a point (with the original set, they get a detective chip, while with pen and paper the corresponding letter is added to the player's score tracker). 
Remember that the winning piles are the longest ones.

### End of the game
The game ends when, at the end of a round, a player is the only one to have obtained the favor of all MMMs. If more than one player have achieve that, they empty their score trackers and the game continues.
