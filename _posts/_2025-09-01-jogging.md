Had already:

- completely switched from Windows to Linux (first year of uni, thanks to a teacher who lied to us and said we _absolutely_ needed Linux to program in C, and aided by the fact that my first attempt at dual booting failed. I happily decided not to persevere)
- stopped using Facebook (for the most part before coming to Sweden, but I did use it a little when I was in desperate need of temporary accomodation)
- switched from Google Maps to OpenStreetMap (and became an OSM contributor along the way!)

Did:

- finally got a [Fripost](https://fripost.org/) email address and redirected all of my personal (Google) emails there. This also gives me access to a Nextcloud instance, which has allowed me to replace:
  - my Google Calendar (this was a big one, because I _love_ the UI of Google Calendar). On my computers, I currently use Nextcloud's web app (although I would like a nice-looking desktop app). On my phone, I opted for the [Fossify](https://www.fossify.org/) calendar, which is okay enough
  - my FOSS, but painfully high maintenance, task manager. On my phone, I use [tasks.org](https://tasks.org/), which is quite awesome
  - of course, my various Google Drives and Microsoft Whatevers, but I've never really stored anything important there
- permanently deleted my (already inactive) Facebook account (well, I guess I'm still a wait-30-days zombie at the time of publishing this, but it is happening)
- started watching YouTube more and more anonymously, thanks to [LibreTube](https://libretube.dev/) and [FreeTube](https://freetubeapp.io/) 
- fully stopped using Pocket for my "read later" list (well, it helped that it ceased to exist). My current solution is described in an [earlier blog post](TODO: "Out of Pocket: a new way to read the web") 

Will do/TODO:

- reluctantly move away from Visual Studio Code, or at least switch to [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/). I was considering [zed](https://zed.dev/), but their current focus on human-AI collaboration annoys me almost as much as the idea of using a Microsoft (albeit open source) product  
- quit Instagram. This is actually also a hard one, because I do like some of the mechanics of Instagram (such as that story replies to anyone are personal messages) and lots of people I want to keep in touch with still use it, but I think it is time to do this anyway. I created a [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) account as a replacement, but I didn't quite find what I was looking for. I might try Mastodon or just quit social media entirely

Didn't:

- leave GitHub in favor of GitLab or CodeBerg. It would be too impractical for me to do that right now due to my work at [Språkbanken Text](https://github.com/spraakbanken/), my ongoing collaborations _outside_ of Språkbanken Text, ([this one](https://github.com/Niklas-Deworetzki/cqp-tree) being currently the coolest), and my involvement in both [Universal Dependencies](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/) and [GrammaticalFramework](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/). Besides, I do still really like GitHub, even though it's getting more and more bloated and buggy since its acquisition by Microsoft
- stop using my work (Outlook) email. This is not permitted (I can't even redirect the emails to my Fripost address) and although I long considered an act of civil disobedience, I decided against it because a) quitting Outlook and not quitting GitHub wouldn't be particularly coherent and b) I'm trying to strike a balance between software freedom and not being hard to work with
- refuse to use Zoom entirely. I certainly don't use Zoom for my personal communication, and I'll try to propose alternatives (in-person meetings and Jitsi) as often as possible, but I will most likely not sabotage any work meeting over this
- quit Slack and Discord. I use both for work very sporadically, so I don't think this is worth the hassle. With my friends, I use Discord less and less, so I might delete both accounts when I finish my PhD
- quit Telegram. I'm just not ready for this. At least 90% of my personal communication goes through Telegram as of now. If I decide to switch, it'll be a long and gradual process
- quit Spotify. This is also difficult in practice, but I'm considering it.
