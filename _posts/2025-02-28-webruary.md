Ever since I realized [how beautifully simple and effective of a technology RSS is](https://harisont.github.io/l-informatico-di-famiglia/2022/03/05/rss-en.html), I've been accumulating articles to read later on [Pocket](https://getpocket.com).
This may the inevitable consequence of a hectic PhD life, but I also want to blame myself for using Pocket a little bit. 
While having an easily accessible archive of good, _already consumed_ web content makes sense (and would make even more sense if I wasn't relying on Pocket's servers and proprietary app to keep it going), my "Pocket saves" mostly consist of stuff that _hasn't_ been read yet, and that probably won't even be opened as long as it stays on Pocket.
Not only do I find myself much more prone to read on paper or on my e-reader, but the initially pretty good reading experience on Pocket has been steadily declining for the past few years, making it very unlikely for me to read anything that takes longer than five minutes on it.
Also, Pocket is (mostly) LIFO, meaning that old things never come out of it once they start accumulating.

Over the past two or three years, I tried to hack my way out of this situation.
First, I considered writing a Pocket client for my Pocketbook e-reader, but neither the Pocket API nor the Pocketbook SDK were remotely intellegible for me.
Then, I decided to simply write [a script that would build small ebooks (aka "pocketbooks") from a list of "saves" exported from the Pocket website](https://github.com/harisont/pockebooks).
This second attempt was most promising, but I recently realized that, as always, technology is a tool and not a direct answer to any problem: the time had come for me to __stop reading books and clear the Pocket backlog__ so that I can leave the platform behind for good.

"Webruary" (Web February) was my first serious go at this, and since by definition everything that I ever saved on Pocket is available on the WWW, I thought it'd really make sense to share the highlights from this peculiar reading month on my blog.
As always, in the language in which the content I refer to is written in.

## Una serie di articoli piú o meno recenti di [Internazionale.it](https://www.internazionale.it/) sul tema dell'intelligenza artificiale
Raramente sono soddisfatta dal modo in cui i media generalisti, spesso oscillanti tra panico ed hype, trattano il tema dell'IA.
Devo dire però che, negli ultimi tempi, mi sembra che Internazionale stia facendo un ottimo lavoro nel parlare in modo equilibrato ed allo stesso tempo stimolante - per quanto non sempre curato dal punto di vista della lingua - sia delle tecnologie in sé che delle politiche in merito e in generale delle conseguenze sulla società.
Mi fa molto piacere anche il fatto che molti articoli sul tema siano interamente prodotto della redazione di Internazionale e non traduzioni di articoli già apparsi su riviste internazionali.

In particolare consiglio:

- [La lista dei nomi proibiti dall’intelligenza artificiale](https://www.internazionale.it/notizie/alberto-puliafito/2024/12/09/lista-nomi-proibiti-intelligenza-artificiale), di Alberto Puliafito, sul tema dei guardrail che aziende come OpenAI inseriscono all'interno dei modelli di IA generativa
- [I proletari dell'intelligenza artificiale](https://www.internazionale.it/reportage/laura-melissari/2024/08/06/intelligenza-artificiale-lavoratori-sfruttamento), di Laura Melissari, incentrato sui lavoratori che si celano dietro la gran parte dei sistemi "intelligenti"

## Some past posts from [Nicky Case's blog](https://blog.ncase.me/)
I had somehow lost touch (parasocial relationships at their best) with Nicky Case despite her abundant blogging activity in 2024.
I know and admire Nicky mostly for her interactive explanations ([I even co-translated one to Italian a few years ago!](https://harisont.github.io/covid-19/)), but I hadn't read much of her more casual posts.

This month, I enjoyed [ Welp, I'm 30. (30 tips for my 13-year-old self)](https://blog.ncase.me/30/) (especially the ["emotions are sensors"](https://blog.ncase.me/30/#tip_7), ["healthy relationships are conditional & transactional"](https://blog.ncase.me/30/#tip_10) and ["backup beliefs"](https://blog.ncase.me/30/#tip_22) concepts).
The awfully long [Clearing out the idea closet (47 projects on my backlog)](https://blog.ncase.me/backlog/) may have been less engaging, but it is inspiring me to do something similar, maybe keeping a _quadernino delle idee_ again, like when I was a child.

## The travel notes of a Victoria to Sitka crossing on a sailboat
Speaking of parasocial relationships, [100R](https://100r.co/site/home.html), the internet presence of Rek and Devine, a couple of artist-programmer sailors, is one of my favorite places on the entire World Wide Web. 
Even though I have no interest in sailing and have an intentionally different lifestyle, I somehow relate to the way of being of these two humans and used to feel a strange connection to them as a couple.
The transcript of their [Victoria to Sitka logbook](https://100r.co/site/victoria_to_sitka_logbook.html) was a cozy evening read for me and brought back good memories of [Busy Doing Nothing](https://100r.co/site/busy_doing_nothing.html) (another one of their travel notebooks that was turned into an actual book). And, of course, of K.

## Sjätte numret av tidskriften [IDÉ](https://tidskriftenide.com/)
IDÉ är en student- och alumndriven tidskrift för idéhistoria vid Göteborgs universitet.
Egentligen är jag särskilt förtjust i IDÉs tryckversion, som delas ut gratis vid min fakultet, och läste därför på papper i detta fall. 
Tekniskt sett var det ett undantag från W-regeln, men det gjordes i samma anda då jag ackumulerar även tidningar. 
Jag uppskattade speciellt mycket [Axel Perssons essä om två helt olika historiska perspektiv om begreppet "trädgårdsstad"](https://tidskriftenide.com/Axel-Person-Den-foranderliga-tradgardsstaden/).
