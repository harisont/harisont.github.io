It's that time of the year again: the [Göteborg Film Festival](https://goteborgfilmfestival.se/en/) närmar sig and I find myself eagerly browsing through the programme in search of new animated movies to watch with the friends and colleagues I have dragged into this yearly activity.

I'm not looking for major children's cartoon productions.
Rather, I am interested in the kind of animation I was first exposed to back in (probably) 2012 at [Rabbitfest](https://filmfreeway.com/Rabbitfest), in Perugia.
I am forever grateful that my hometown used to (_sigh!_) have such a unique festival, entirely dedicated to independent animation and, for once[^1], mostly targeting adults.
It introduced me to what for me was a completely new genre, and I enjoyed it to the point that it inspired me to organize a _cineforum_[^2] at my high school.

Before the beginning of this year's edition of the festival, I want to share some of the memorable independent animated feature films[^3] I have watched until now.
I might update this list in the future.

#### [_Persepolis_ (2007)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persepolis_(film))
This is by far the most well-known movie on this list. My family borrowed it from the library right after we read Marjane Satrapi's homonymous graphic novel, well before Rabbitfest was a thing. To this days, this is both one of the best comics I've ever read and one of the best animated movies I've ever watched.
_Persepolis_ is an autobiographical drama tracing the recent history of Iran. 
What I enjoy the most in Satrapi's work is the storytelling, but I remember being impressed with the animation too. 
Already in 2007, frame-by-frame animation on paper was quite the exception. 
Plus, just like the graphic novel it is based on, the movie is in black and white.
Watching it, it really felt like the character from the comic were coming to life.

#### [_Mary and Max_ (2009)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_and_Max)
I watched _Mary and Max_ at my first Rabbitfest and never rewatched it since, but I clearly remember it as one of the heaviest films of my teen years.
I somehow visually associate it with Pixar's [_Up_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up_(2009_film)), (which I have never watched the in its entirety), even if the former is in stop-motion and the latter computer-animated (turns out the premiered in the same year).
_Mary and Max_ is however a much darker movie, dealing with depression, anxiety and alcoholism, all through the story of a long-distance friendship between a lonely eight-year-old girl and a middle-aged autistic adult (so much for those who say animation isn't well suited for serious matters!). 
I do not remember how the movie ends.

#### [_Alois Nebel_ (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alois_Nebel)
Like _Persepolis_, _Alois Nebel_ is a dramatic black-and-white animated feature film based on a comic book (by Jaroslav Rudiš and Jaromír 99).
Unlike Satrapi's story, however, _Alois Nebel_ is a historical novel and the movie is animated with [rotoscoping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotoscoping).
The result is visually stunning and perfectly complemented by a beautiful soundtrack, by the Czech rock band [Priessnitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priessnitz_(band)). 


#### [_Crulic: the path to beyond_ (2011)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crulic:_The_Path_to_Beyond)
Crulic was my first animated documentary, telling the story of a Romanian man who died while on a hunger strike after being unjustly arrested for thefth in Poland.
This is a difficult-to-watch movie, but also one worth watching. 
Here, animation, which largely consists of animated photographs, becomes the perfect tool to tell a real but underdocumented story.

#### [_The island_ (2021)](https://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insula_(film_din_2021))
10 years after watching _Crulic_ in Perugia, I went for this movie at the Gothenburg Film Festival because I remembered the director's name, Anca Damian. 
Although also dealing with a difficult theme (in this case, immigration), _The Island_ is a completely different work: a chaotic, psychedelic musical that left me moderately confused.
Still, not easy to forget.

#### [_Flee_ (2021)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flee_(film))
_Flee_ is a documentary/animated interview, recounting the life of an Afghan refugee in Denmark.
Animation-wise, this is not that special, but the content is interesting and, together with _Cinema Pameer_ (a Swedish documentary about an Afghan cinema), this was the best movie I watched at the 2021 (online) edition of the Göteborg Film Festival.

#### [_Aurora's sunrise_ (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora%27s_Sunrise)
_Aurora's sunrise_ is again a documentary about the Armenian Genocide survivor Aurora Mardiganian.
While this is not one of my personal favorites, the story told in this movie is truly unbelievable and the animation objectively very well done.

#### [_Blind willow, sleeping woman_ (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blind_Willow,_Sleeping_Woman_(film))
As a keen Haruki Murakami reader, I could not miss the movie adaptation of six of his short stories.
Interestingly, this is not a collection of shorts, and, at least to some extent, the stories blend with each other.
As dreamlike as the original, this movie definitely works in my opinion, but it might be a bit boring for those uninitiated to Murakami's writing.

#### [_My love affair with marriage_ (2022)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Love_Affair_with_Marriage)
Last but definitely not least, Signe Baumane's _My love affair with marriage_ might be one of my favorite movies, not just within weird independent animation for adults, not just within animation in general, but overall; all this while not at all being the most aesthetically appealing in this list.
Baumane has Satrapi's self-awareness and Zerocalcare[^4]'s ability to _sdrammatizzare_[^5].
In this movie, she deals with gender roles with a mix brilliant narrative devices and brutal realism, plus some neuroscience.
Guess I'll have to watch everything else she does.

[^1]: While this is slowly changing, 10 years ago, at least in Italy, comics and animation were still considered something childish and definitely not viable media for addressing important issues
[^2]: I am only now learning that this word doesn't exist in English. I would count on the readers' perspicacity, but just in case, [here](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cineforum) is the meaning (cf. definition 1)
[^3]: I am explicitly excluding shorts and children's movies here, not because I have anything against them, but, on the contrary, because I don't want this list to grow disproportionately: I have seen too many good ones
[^4]: Another one who recently did great animation for adults, unfortunately not yet on the big screen
[^5]: _s_ + _drammatizzare_, literally _un_ + _dramatize_, "lower (usually through irony) the degree of dramaticiness of a tragic event". Commonly translated as _downplay_, but I think the English word has a much more negative connotation.
