## _Giorno_[^1] 1: Göteborg-somewhere 20 km south of Frederikshavn
Lunch & MTG on the ferry to Frederikshavn. 

Short ride to an epic free campsite, "Professorens plantage", with three wooden shelters (one with a view!), fireplaces and tables.
The beach, which is 400 m away, is grey and covered of beautiful shells of different kinds; some look like the best ones in Lido Rossello - never seen in Scandinavia before!
The sand is thin, like, _la spiaggia di velluto_[^2] di Senigallia.
The only drawback of this place is the lack of running water, otherwise idyllic.

## _Giorno_[^1] 2: idyllic campsite - Egense Strand camping
A deer peeped out from a field!
This was while we were biking until the next town, Aså (or "Asaa", but I think the other spelling is funnier because it's the reverse of "Åsa", which was one of our first stops on the Swedish side of Kattegatt).
We had lunch with supermarket food there and played MTG in the harbor, which had a nice clean toilet with room to change clothes, as well as tables in the shadow.
Here a Venezuelan (or was he Colombian?) guy also explained us that, in Denmark, a sign with a daisy means a bike road.
We then walked to the nearby beach and took a swim, or should I say a stroll? in the warm water between a sand bank and another.

We then proceeded to a nice small town called Hals, where we had decent pizza and subsequently took the ferry. 
Immediately after there is a paid but incredibly cheap camping. 
Funnily enough, though, children have to pay to use the playground (but not the pool!) for an hour. 
Mah. 

## _Giorno_[^1] 3: Egense - Hadsund
Woke up in the cold (maybe it had rained a little) and ate inside, charging my powerbank - good to be at a paid camping.

Long lunch stop next to the supermarket in Bælum, a very boring place with not even a table.
For the whole time we were there, the road was calling me.
But, already for the second time, the supermarket came with a _pantställe med vattenkran, vilket är ganska bra för att diska_[^3].

And after Bælum, the most awesomest bike lane of Denmark begins.
A bike-only straight road in the middle of nowhere, only trees and fields (of course, we learned it is built on top of an old railway).
After a few kms of this, we saw a sign for the Danish equivalent of _öppen gård_[^4] called Solpletten and decided to take a look.
It's a beautiful place to relax, built by volunteers from all over the works, full of art installations and playful things, such as a drum set made of kitchen pots. 
We stayed for a bit and played MTG while snacking.

We then continued to Hadsund, where we set up the tent in another even cheaper _obemannad_[^5] (!) camping/hostel with only one shower but surprisingly clean toilets.
Then we went into town for dinner.
C. had a disgusting calzone with spaghetti.
I had a delicious pita with chicken.
