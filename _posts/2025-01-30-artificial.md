> I was happy to finally read what I consider to be an exemplary short article on the topic of AI on a relatively mainstream Italian magazine.
> The text was interesting for me as a language technologist and yet, based on my close family's reaction, truly accessible for the uninitiated. 
> Even more unusually, it succeeds in proposing a critical reflection on large language models without painting dystopian scenarios, maintaining the focus on the specific, concrete problem addressed.
>
> I was also happy to learn that, despite its rather late publication last year, it was the most read article of the online version of Internazionale in 2024 and even happier upon discovering that [I could openly make it circulate beyond my Italian-speaking circles](https://www.internazionale.it/copyright/).

Artificial intelligence language models must avoid producing texts that violate the law. They must also avoid using inappropriate language. But between the end of November and the beginning of December 2024, we found out that, in some cases, they also have to avoid using certain personal names. 

It all started with David Mayer: some had noticed that writing "David Mayer" caused an immediate interruption of any conversation with ChatGpt and, in some cases, led to an error message: "I'm unable to produce a response". 

But who is David Mayer? It depends. If you type his name into a search engine - limiting the search to what had been published prior to the beginning of this story, as I did [here](https://internazionale.us16.list-manage.com/track/click?u=9606152151dbc9a1003b9d59b&id=49079eaf77&e=1a33191022) - or try to look it up on Wikipedia in various languages, you may find, for instance: a clothing brand; a composer, orchestra conductor and MIT lecturer named David Mayer Epstein, who is incidentally also the author of an array of seemingly interesting books on intelligence, biological aspects of aesthetics and relationship between music and the brain; a member of the very wealthy Rotschild banking family, David Mayer de Rothschild; a British historian, David Mayer. Not to mention David R. Mayer, a US politician and mayor of Gloucester Township, New Jersey, and David Delaney Mayer, a 1992 US documentary filmmaker. 

Search further and you'll surely find other homonyms. However, the historian and the conductor died in 2023 and 2002 respectively. The following two are not well-known enough to make headlines. Rothschild, on the other hand, is still alive, extremely rich, described as an "environmental adventurer". He is the mind behind the Plastiki project and seems perfect to end up in some conspiracy theory, as well as under the media spotlight. Except Rothschild denied ever asking OpenAI to block his name and ChatGPT's behavior turned out to be a bug. Or at least, that's what OpenAI always says: in fact, if you ask ChatGPT "who is David Mayer" now, you'll get a list similar to mina (although it doesn't usually mention the composer or the clothing brand).

But a list of ChatGPT-forbidden names exists nonetheless: Brian Hood, Jonathan Turley, Jonathan Zittrain, David Faber are all names that block the tool. As is the name of Guido Scorza, a member of the board of the Italian data protection authority. 

"I merely asked OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, to comply with current European regulations", says Scorza, "which grant all data subjects - i.e. all individuals whose personal data is being processed without explicit consent - the right to demand that the data holder stop such processing.
Anyone, as long as they live in Europe, could easily do the same through the platform OpenAI uses to deliver the ChatGPT service, and would achieve, I believe, the same result".
