Today I was feeling rather queasy<br>
and had a goal to take it easy<br>
so when this one dear friend of mine<br>
proposed to play board games online<br>
there was no reason to think twice<br>
but we'd not even rolled the dice<br>
when I heard Outlook's dreadful chime<br>
I tried to close the browser tab<br>
but my gaze was easy to grab.<br>
The email came straight from arXiv<br>
who find our paper can't go live<br>
due to overlap and repetition<br>
with one more article submission.<br>
They kindly ask us to combine<br>
them back in one, so to revive<br>
the longer paper that once was<br>
and for the journal was lost cause.<br>
It's funny how they could compare<br>
with something that's not even there.<br>
Could be a mistake, I would dare say<br>
and I'd appeal if that's ok.
