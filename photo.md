I have been passionate about photography since age 8.
In the last few years, my focus has switched from individual shots to small projects, such as:

- [__Postcards from Gothenburg__](https://harisont.github.io/postcards-from-gothenburg/), a project for a summer course at the University of Gothenburg and luckily also the only website I've ever had to write from scratch
- [__@unottica__](https://www.instagram.com/unottica/), an abandoned attempt to find a consistent a personal style
- my ongoing __photography blog post series__:
  1. [_GB-AG: fotografie di un viaggio per mare e per terra_](https://harisont.github.io/unottica/2022/11/13/gbag.html), documenting an interrail trip from Gothenburg to Agrigento (in Italian)
  2. [_Vardagsbilder_](https://harisont.github.io/unottica/2023/04/09/vardagsbilder-sv.html), a collection of pictures taken with a pocket camera over the course of March 2023 (available in Swedish and Italian)
  3. [_Føroyar_](https://harisont.github.io/photography/2023/12/27/foroyar.html), a slightly more ambitious project recounting a journey to the Faroe Islands with images and an interactive map (in English)
  4. [_Påskresan_](https://harisont.github.io/cykelturism/paskresan.html), a series of snapshots from a biking trip to Alingsås and Borås (in Swedish)

## Reading, writing, translating
Aside from academic writing, my [__blog__](blog.md) is home to silly rhymes, comments on whatever books and comics I read and many more scribbles.
In the future, I would like to try to do more popular science content.

I have also contributed to the __Italian translation__ of various things on the web, for instance [Nicky Case's interactive article _What happens next?_](https://harisont.github.io/covid-19/) and more recently [Karin Boye's short story _Blomningstid_](https://harisont.github.io/traduzioni/2023/08/18/blomningstid.html).
