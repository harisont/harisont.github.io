Being into photography since age 8, I am the unhappy owner of a relatively large and unwieldy archive of pictures.
Some of them, however, were lucky enough to end up in some sort of _project_:

- [_Postcards from Gothenburg / Vykort från Göteborg / Cartoline da Göteborg_ (2021)](https://harisont.github.io/postcards-from-gothenburg/) is an assignment for a summer course I took at HDK-Valand, as well as one of the very few websites I've ever had the misfortune of having to write from scratch
- my [blog](https://harisont.github.io/blog.html) contains a handful of illustrated posts. Since I've given up on any kind of content categorization, I'll point you to the ones I'm the proudest of:
  - [_Føroyar_ (2023)](https://harisont.github.io/2023/12/27/foroyar.html), documenting a trip to the Faroe Island. Since I traveled there for a conference, some of the pictures were also part of a departmental art exhibition later on. My friend and colleague Ricardo wrote a nice [blog post about the event](https://rimusa.github.io/hobby/SFS-art-exhibition/) 
  - [_Vardagsbilder / Foto del quotidiano_ (2023)](https://harisont.github.io/2023/04/09/vardagsbilder-sv.html), the result of a month with an old compact camera in my pocket
- throughout the years, I put together a few photobooks, both handmade and not. These were always meant as gift to individual friends or family, so they only exist in one copy, but I have (suboptimal) PDF exports of two of the ones that I got printed:
  - [_Do not enter if you think putin is cool, others please come in_ (2025)](assets/photobooks/baltics.pdf), documenting another post-conference holiday in the Baltic countries
  - [_Nya vardagsbilder / Altre foto del quotidiano_ (2025)](assets/photobooks/nya_vardagsbilder.pdf), sort of a sequel of _Vardagsbilder / Foto del quotidiano_, although the pictures are taken over a longer period of time and with a slightly better pocket camera. This book contained some text, for instance on the [cover](assets/img/adventyr/capas.jpg), but it was somehow lost in the conversion to PDF
  
  my next goal is to self-publish a book using exclusively FOSS tools
- I used to have an Instagram account where I tried to create a visually consistent photo gallery. A similar gallery of my own is currently in the works.
