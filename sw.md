## Language technology
- [__L2-UD__](https://github.com/harisont/L2-UD), a toolkit for parallel ([L1-L2](https://aclanthology.org/W17-6306.pdf)) UD treebanks
- [__STUnD__](https://github.com/harisont/STUnD), a GUI for L2-UD's search functionalities
- [__concept-alignment__](https://github.com/harisont/concept-alignment), a tool for syntax-based phrase and word alignment, used in both L2-UD and STUnD
- [__conllu-plus-converter__](https://github.com/harisont/conllu-plus-converter), a simple conversion tool for [CoNNL-U (Plus) files](https://universaldependencies.org/format.html)
- [__Rick Lime__](https://github.com/harisont/rick-lime), a silly chatbot that helps you write limericks
- [__arrè__](https://github.com/harisont/arre), a collection of Python scripts to download and transcribe recordings of trials from the Radio Radicale archives.

I have also contributed to:

- the [__Lärka__](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/larkalabb/) language learning platform
- the UD portion of [__gf-ud__](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-ud) toolkit for dependency trees and GF-UD conversions
- [__deptreepy__](https://github.com/aarneranta/deptreepy/), a Python port of part of __gf-ud__, where I re-implemented tree visualizations
- (minimally) the __Italian [GF RGL](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/gf-rgl)__.

## LaTeX themes & templates
- [__lucid__](https://github.com/harisont/lucid), the beamer theme I use for 100% of my presentations since 2018, recently revamped
- [__GUnofficial-poster-template__](https://github.com/harisont/GUnofficial-poster-template), the only poster template I will ever use if I really have to make a poster.

## Misc
- [__me-tadah__](https://github.com/harisont/me-tadah), the simplest possible ebook metadata editor
- [__Librery__](https://github.com/harisont/Librery), the first and probably last complete Android app I'll ever have the patience to write

## Tutorials
- __Impara l'Haskell e mettilo da parte__, a basic Haskell course consisting in [video lessons](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fKcYGimkXYd-N5ryesKqw) and [code examples](https://github.com/harisont/imparalhaskell). The course is entirely in Italian, as the goal was to create learning materials easily accessible to my fellow citizens that who use the language barrier as an excuse not to learn my favorite programming language. This project is currently on hiatus ever since I've started teaching more and more in person
