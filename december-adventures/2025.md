## Day 1: setup
Textbook Monday around here, which leaves little room for adventure besides setting up this log.
For the first few days or adventuring, I'll be focusing on [wytiwys](https://github.com/harisont/wytiwys/), a programming project that is technically work but also very out of the ordinary (as well as of my comfort zone) and therefore kind of fun.
From next week on, I hope to make time for working on a multitude of small hobby projects.
