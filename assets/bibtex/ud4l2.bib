    abstract = "Universal Dependencies (UD) is gaining popularity as an annotation standard for second language (L2) material. Grammatical errors and other interlanguage phenomena, however, pose significant challenges that official guidelines only address in part. In this paper, we give an overview of current annotation practices and provide some suggestions for harmonizing guidelines for learner corpora."
