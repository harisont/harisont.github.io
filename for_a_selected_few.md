If you a member of one of my _ristretti circoli_[^1], I might have given you a password. 
Choose the relevant circle and follow the corresponding link to access what I told you I was going to give you access to.

- If you are __me__, [click here](https://harisont.github.io/area-riservata/)
- if you are __a close friend of mine__, [click here](https://harisont.github.io/pronouns/)
- if you are one of my __thesis supervisors or someone else I work with at Språkbanken__, [click here](https://harisont.github.io/hdemica)

If you don't have a password but think you deserve one, feel free to [contact me](mailto:arianna.masciolini@gmail.com).

[^1]: it just means "select circles", but I'm not sure it's clear it's ironic if I write it in English
