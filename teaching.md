## Teaching

### Courses
Starting in 2019, I've been involved in several programming and language technology courses at the University of Gothenburg and at the Chalmers University of Technology:

- LT2214 Computational Syntax (teacher)
- LT2001 Introduction to Programming (teacher)
- DAT455 Introduktion till Programmering i Python (co-course responsible)
- DAT515/DIT515 Advanced programming in Python (teacher)
- DIT143 Functional Programming (teaching assistant)

I was also a recurrent speaker in the [Data Plumbers' Corner](https://github.com/LaboratorioSperimentale/Formazione-data_plumbers_corner) 2024-2025 seminar series organized by the Laboratorio Sperimentale del Dipartimento di Lingue, Letterature e Culture Moderne (LILEC) of the University of Bologna and a teacher in the [9th Grammatical Framework Summer School](https://school.grammaticalframework.org/2025/).

### Supervision
I have had the pleasure to supervise the following student projects:

- Christina Klironomou:
  - Master's thesis about automatic parsing and error tagging of L2 Greek (ongoing)
  - _Universal Dependencies for L2 learners of modern Greek: annotation and challenges_ (course project)
- Caroline Grand-Clement, _Sharing is caring: can sharing a linguistic background with learners give annotators of learner data in UD an advantage?_ (course project)
- Marco Leali, _Terminology-Aware MT using hybrid rule-based methods and LLMs_ (course project co-supervised with David Wallgren)
- Dawit Jembere, [_Breaking Barriers: Enhancing Universal Dependency Parsing for Amharic_](https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/88121) (Master's thesis in Language Technology)

## Teaching materials
- _Impara l'Haskell e mettilo da parte_, a basic Haskell course consisting in video lessons (originally on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6fKcYGimkXYd-N5ryesKqw), then moved to [PeerTube](https://friprogramvarusyndikatet.tv/c/impara_l_haskell_e_mettilo_da_parte_channel/videos)) and [code examples](https://github.com/harisont/imparalhaskell) in Italian. This project is on hiatus ever since I've started teaching more and more in person
- [_py4linguists_](https://github.com/harisont/py4linguists), a small collection of Python exercises for linguists, originally designed for Language Technology students at the University of Gothenburg
