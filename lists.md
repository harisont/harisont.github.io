This is a list of lists of lists I occasionally come back to and try to keep more or less updated. 
Some are notes for my own future reference, some work as FAQ pages about oddly specific topics for students and colleagues, most where originally published as blog posts [here](https://harisont.github.io/blog.html) or on the [Språkbanken Text blog](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/blogg).
