This is a list of lists of lists that I regularly come back to and update. 
Some are meant for my own future reference; some work as FAQ pages about oddly specific topics for students and colleagues; some where originally published as blog posts [here](https://harisont.github.io/blog.html) or on the [Språkbanken Text blog](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/blogg).

- syntax (mostly computational):
  - [FACS - FAQs about Computational Syntax](lists/facs.md)
  - [Rarely Asked Questions about Swedish UD](lists/svud-raq.md)
- other computer stuff:
  - [Frequently forgotten shell commands](lists/commands.md)
  - [Web development notes](lists/web-dev.md)
  - [Fantastic feeds and where to find them](lists/feeds.md)

  - [Animation taken seriously](lists/serious_animation.md)
