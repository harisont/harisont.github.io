This is a list of lists of lists that I regularly come back to and update. 
Some are meant for my own future reference; some work as FAQ pages about oddly specific topics dedicated to students and colleagues; some were originally (or will eventually be) published as blog posts [here](https://harisont.github.io/blog.html) or on the [Språkbanken Text blog](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/blogg).
