## Photography
I have been passionate about photography since age 8.
In the last few years, my focus has switched from individual shots to small projects, such as:

- [__Postcards from Gothenburg__](https://harisont.github.io/postcards-from-gothenburg/), a project for a summer course at the University of Gothenburg and luckily also the only website I've ever had to write from scratch
- [__@unottica__](https://www.instagram.com/unottica/), an abandoned attempt to find consistent a personal style
- my ongoing __photography blog post series__:
  1. [_GB-AG: fotografie di un viaggio per mare e per terra_](https://harisont.github.io/unottica/2022/11/13/gbag.html), documenting an interrail trip from Gothenburg to Agrigento (in Italian)
  2. [_Vardagsbilder_](https://harisont.github.io/unottica/2023/04/09/vardagsbilder-sv.html), a collection of pictures taken with a pocket camera over the course of March 2023 (available in Swedish and Italian)
  3. [_Føroyar_](https://harisont.github.io/photography/2023/12/27/foroyar.html), a slightly more ambitious project recounting a journey to the Faroe Islands with images and an interactive map (in English)

## Reading, writing, translating
Aside from academic writing, my [__blog__](blog.md) is home to silly rhymes, comments on whatever books and comics I read and many more scribbles.
In the future, I would like to try to do more popular science content.

I have also contributed to the __Italian translation__ of various things on the web, for instance [Nicky Case's interactive article _What happens next?_](https://harisont.github.io/covid-19/) and more recently [Karin Boye's short story _Blomningstid_](https://harisont.github.io/traduzioni/2023/08/18/blomningstid.html).

## Music
Despite several failures to learn how to play different musical instruments, I've been part of innumerable choirs and two smaller vocal ensembles:

- __VoxInFabula__ (2013-2018, here is a [funny video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaMoZsXScj0) I am still quite proud of)
- [__Tritonus__](https://www.youtube.com/@tritonus_ensemble/videos) (still active in Umbria, and actually proceeded to become really good immediately _after_ I moved to Sweden).

Another way I've tried to deal with the frustration of not being able to play anything remotely well myself was of course to instruct my computer to do that for me. [In Haskell](https://github.com/lcdsa/geb).

## Outdoors and sports
I used to run quite a lot, but as of now I'm more into all sorts of human-powered wheeled vehicles.
Right now I'm especially enjoying [cycling around Västra Götaland](https://harisont.github.io/cykelturism/2024/06/09/cykelturism.html), which occasionally involves camping.
I am also an _arrampicatrice della domenica_[^1].
