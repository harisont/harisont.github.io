### ¡Ciao, hi, hej and hola!
I am Arianna ([`PronType=Prs|Number=Sing|Gender=Fem`](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html)), a computational linguist in the making.
This website is the [standard output](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_(stdout)) for all of my [_otium_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otium), from personal projects to academic endeavors (the line is blurred):

- [research](research.md) is where you can find out about my publications, talks and other research output
- [teaching](teaching.md) is a page where I gather information about the courses I am or have been involved in and the student projects I have (had) the pleasure to supervise
- [software](sw.md) contains links to assorted programming projects, both research-related and not
- [photography](photo.md) is dedicated to the hobby that has accompanied me the longest (but not necessarily the most intensely)
- [stdout](blog.md) is my chaotically multilingual blog, where you can find a little bit of everything
- [[[[a]]]](lists.md) is a list of lists of lists of things I and/or someone else often need to come back to
