title: Ciao, hi, hej and hola
---

Hi and welcome to my chaotically multilingual blog! 

Parlo __italiano__ come prima lingua, I find it easiest to write technical texts in __English__, jag bor i Göteborg och försöker hela tiden förbättra min __svenska__, pero el idioma que me hace sentir más feliz siempre ha sido el __español__. 

Even though my [Master's thesis](https://github.com/harisont/concept-alignment) was in Machine Translation, I like translating stuff myself too, and it is my ambition to write all the content of this blog in English + 1 (as a side effect, that would make a nice set of parallel texts). But more realistically, get ready for a bunch of texts in broken `*ish`[^1] where the language is chosen based on topic and audience but also less sensible factors such as mood, place and time of writing.

Noticed a _strafalcione_[^2] in something I've written? You're welcome to fix it and open a [pull request](https://github.com/harisont/harisont.github.io)!

[^1]: the only language whose name doesn't end in -ish should be alright, I hope.
[^2]: a very, very bad grammatical error or conceptual mistake.
