### ¡Ciao, hi, hej and hola!
I'm Arianna ([`PronType=Prs|Number=Sing|Gender=Fem`](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html)) and I'm an aspiring [computational linguist](research.md) with [too many hobbies](more.md).

### Long story short
###### (if you want the boring version, take a look at my [CV](https://github.com/harisont/cv/raw/master/cv.pdf))
I grew up in [Perugia](https://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/42278#map=11/43.1399/12.3691), where I spent my teen years using my language skills to hide my total lack of mathematical knowledge.
After graduating high school, I figured I'd ~~punish~~ challenge myself and enroll in a Computer Science program, which against all odds I ended up completing and thoroughly enjoying, both mostly thanks to great company.
During this process, I accidentally re-discovered language through a course on compilers and abruptly moved to [Gothenburg](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/25930131) together with my former _sambo_[^1] [K.](https://harisont.github.io/kappanneu/).
While I was telling myself and everyone else that I was only going to be there for a two-year Master's in Language Technology, but after 6 years I'm still here. 
After graduation and a short but fun time working as a software developer at [Digital Grammars](https://www.digitalgrammars.com/), I embarked in the longer-term project of a PhD in Natural Language Processing at [Språkbanken Text](https://spraakbanken.gu.se/), where I work at the intersection between Computational Syntax and Second Language Acquisition.
