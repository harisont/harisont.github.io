The [December Adventure](https://eli.li/december-adventure) is a chill alternative to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), which is exactly what I need in December: the darkness of this month prompts me to spend even more time on my computer, and my goal is to spend at least some of that time every day doing something I'm excited about. 
Doesn’t even really have to be code, as the organizer says.

## Day 1: plans
Textbook Monday around here, which leaves little room for adventure besides setting up this log.
For the first few days of the month, I'll be focusing on [wytiwys](https://github.com/harisont/wytiwys/), a programming project that is technically work but also very out of the ordinary (as well as of my comfort zone) and therefore kind of fun.
The enjoyment I often find in my job blurs the line between work and play, but I hope to soon make time for my hobby projects too.
I won't necessarily start anything new and big. 
The plan is rather to do some pleasurable software maintenance, add some new features to my everyday tools, write one or two blog posts and perhaps work on some long-term photography projects.

## Day 2: WYTIWYS? WTH?!
So, [wytiwys](https://github.com/harisont/wytiwys/) is a web-based graphical [dependency tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar) editor and a component of a larger project aimed at making it easier to look for syntactic patterns in large text collections (WYTIWYS stands for What You Tree Is What You Search).

When [the Query Master](https://www.gu.se/en/research/he-builds-it-systems-that-support-future-language-research) and I started looking into this, we found that [reactive-dep-tree](https://github.com/kirianguiller/reactive-dep-tree) does 95% of what we need, and it does it quite well, so my task is just to implement a couple extra features and make some minor tweaks.
Yet, working on wytiwys is definitely adventurous: it requires forking two (if not three) different repositories, intervening on sparsely documented code in TypeScript - a programming language I've never learned and have no ambition to learn - and, worse still, _doing frontend_.
Nothing like my usual PhD work.

Contrary to my expectations, I am having a blast.
Sure, progress is slow, but working in TypeScript with little documentation is akin to reading in Danish without a dictionary: I know enough Swedish to figure out what's going on, but deciphering individual constructions takes effort.
Satisfyingly enough, I've managed to guess my way through the code until now.
Today I actively looked up something (~~list~~ [array concatenation](https://harisont.github.io/lists/web-dev.html#array-concatenation)) for the first time, and I think it's wild.

I'm happy to report I'm almost done adding one of the most important missing features, adding and removing nodes, but less so about the current solution for additions.
I'll try to simplify the code tomorrow.

## Day 3: LaTeX macros
Change of plans!
I thought I'd have some time to work on wytiwys in the afternoon after a seminar, but that was 150% longer than I anticipated (which I didn't mind), so no lines of TypeScript were written today.

On the other hand, I _did_ squeeze a moment of productination into this morning's paper writing session and finally reminded myself how LaTeX macros work.
It's so simple I can't believe this is my first one in years:

```latex
\newcommand{\footnoteurl}[2]{
    \footnote{\href{#1}{\nolinkurl{#2}}}
} % usage: \footnoteurl{LONG-URL}{NICE-URL}
```

The macro allows me to create footnotes whose content is a single URL with a short version, rendered in the PDF, that would work if the reader copy-pasted the link in a modern browser (but not necessarily when clicked from a PDF reader) and a "full" version that is used when the reader clicks on the link.
For example, I used it as 

```latex
\footnoteurl{https://universaldependencies.org/sv/index.html}{universaldependencies.org/sv}
```

## Day 4: seriously, WTH?
This was a long, frustrating day with no time for work that doesn't feel like work at work.
Had a short late night wytiwys session where I tried to complete the hacky implementation of the "add node" functionality I was working on the day before yesterday. 
It seemed to work within a few minutes of writing code, so I thought I'd leave perfectionism aside and keep it that way.
Needless to say, I soon found a bug which seems to be an underlying library's fault (more specifically, it seem to be due to JavaScript's utter lack of type safety, but take all of this with a grain of salt - the whole reasoning is the output of a tired brain past midnight).
It might indeed be necessary to fork a third repository for this project, both if I just want to fix the bug and if I decide to implement a cleaner solution, which would require that either way.

## Day 5: add/remove node complete and new website section
News from a late evening at the office: I was right about the cause of the bug, although it was not in the library I thought, but in the code wytiwys inherited from reactive-dep-tree itself.
Apparently, TypeScript is perfectly happy to do string + number without throwing a type error, which leads to token IDs such as 31 ("3" + 1) instead of 4 (3 + 1).
The fix is a single line change:

```typescript
// was: headId = e.detail.dragged;
headId = parseInt(e.detail.dragged, 10);
```

...but come on! 
Not even _Python_ lets you sum numbers and strings and it doesn't have "type" in its name.

Anyway, I played a little bit with the stylesheet etc. and now the thing looks like this:

![A dependency tree for the sentence "It was not possible to add or remove nodes." being transformed into "Now it is possible to add or remove nodes!"](../assets/img/das/wytiwys-add-rm.gif)

(I just noticed I forgot to record the text field where I was typing the new values... Whatever, it's late. I should go home)

I also added a [new section](../lists.md) to this website, because apparently after 12 hours at uni I'm too tired to get groceries, make food or go climbing but not for spending time in my text editor (some days are like that). 
I called it `[[[a]]]` because it's a list of lists of lists. 
The contents have been there for a while, but until now they were only accessible to the selected few that knew what the various URLs were.
I would also like to add a list of all of the Straordinarie Scrittrici Svedesi (extraordinary Swedish women writers) I've been reading since starting to learn Swedish.

## Day 6: chores and literature
Today was reserved for all chores I postponed throughout the week and I had plans with a friend for the evening.
But what about the adventure?
I started taking some preliminary notes for the listpost about my favorite Swedish authors I mentioned yesterday.
Coincidentally, a short story written by of them - _Bortbytingen_, by Selma Lagerlöf - is mentioned in a nonfiction book about autistic women I've just finished reading.
I've been wanting to read some Lagerlöf's short stories for some time, so I went to [Litteraturbanken](https://litteraturbanken.se)[^1] with plans to assemble my own ebook (more or less [like I do with blog posts and other web content](https://harisont.github.io/2025/11/30/hmm.html)), but I had forgotten that most short stories are only available as part of the anthologies they were originally part of.
Well, I guess I'll just read more.

__Listening to__: Arja Saijonmaa & Inti-Illimani, _Jag vill tacka livet - 13 sånger av Violeta parra_ - äkta chilefinlandsvenskmusik!

## Day 7: more literature
Today is the quiet before the storm of work and social commitments that will be next week, and some cozy adventuring (as well as some climbing, cooking and a choir concert I'll go to in a bit) is good mental preparation for that.

I spent about _one hour_ trial-and-erroring a single photo of a stack of books I want to use in my upcoming blog post and I'm still unsure whether any of my attempts is good enough.
I guess one of the problems is that I decided to make my own "studio light" with candles, whereas I usually decide if I should take a picture at all based on the goodness of the light life happens to offer me.

{% include image.html file="../assets/img/das/book_stacks.png" description="Several attempts at photographing a stack of books in candlelight." %}

I also started writing the actual blog post, which will be in Italian (the target audience is my family, mostly my parents).

__Listening to__: the local vocal ensemble Sot (live xmas concert).

## Day 8: What You See Is What You Wish You Could Get
I spent the evening refactoring some copy-paste code in wytiwys and adding some SVG elements that do absolutely nothing yet.
Their purpose will be to allow specifying constraints on the (relative) positions of tokens in a sentence.
My trees are now _almost_ as cluttered as they will get (I still have to figure out what symbol to use to signal adjacency between words and, more importantly, where to place it):

![A dependency tree for the sentence "you can't always search what you tree". On top of each node is the emoji of an open lock; the beginning and end of a sentence are marked by an anchor emoji.](../assets/img/das/locks_anchors.png)

__Listening to__: Rolling Stones, _You can't always get what you want_.

## Day 9: music
Today was an unusually musical day. 
A large portion of the afternoon was spent preparing for a music quiz some colleagues and I are organizing for an after-work.

The part where I sat in front of my computer and did something exciting was all about organizing and annotating scans of some renaissance music scores to pass them on to a friend who's part of a wonderful vocal ensemble, Sot, that I've had the pleasure to listen to for the first time last weekend. 
"Excited" isn't exactly the right word to describe how it felt to do this, though: the concert reminded me of the joy I used to find in singing in that kind of ensemble, and going through my scores from that time brings back strong memories. 
The whole experience is rather bittersweet.  

Ironically, today is also the first day of my voluntary musical deprivation phase. 
I stopped paying for Spotify (stoppified?) a few weeks ago; now my subscription ended and I don't have a plan about how to listen to music from now on yet.

__Listening to:__ Tritonus Ensemble ([on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@tritonus_ensemble/videos), for lack of a better alternative).

## Day 10: work, after-work and after-after-work work
Today went like this:

1. work
2. after-work
3. work.

First thing in the morning tomorrow, my group is having a discussion about the reliance of our work (crucially, the development of an open research infrastructure for linguistic research) on proprietary SaaS. 
I am the proponent and organizer of that discussion.
Preparing for that strikes me as adventurous enough.

## Day 11: small website updates
I had another very long work day (group meeting, supervision meeting, answering a bunch of emails I had neglected, two and a half hours' worth of syntactic annotation).
All I managed to do was to update my nerdy [RAQs about Swedish syntax in the Universal Dependencies framework](../lists/svud-raq.md#vad-adj) (which is kind of a time consuming but fun side effect of the annotation work) and start a music listening diary for this transition phase from Spotify to I don't know yet what.

__Listening to__: 
_Julbarock med Anna Fusek och La Misticanza_ - a lovely English + Italian baroque music concert on Swedish national radio (also [online](https://www.sverigesradio.se/avsnitt/barockmusik-med-anna-fusek-och-la-misticanza--2)).

## Day 12: hobby as work, work as hobby
Got up early to meet one the awesome students I'm supervising and compare our syntactic annotations.
It is the end of a demanding work week (assuming I don't have to work during the weekend), so I opted for only doing fun work tasks for the rest of the day.
I [updated the UD RAQs](../lists/svud-raq.md#the-abcs-of-ud) again and prepared two mini-presentations for the internal end-of-year show-and-tell we're having on Monday. 
One is about wytiwys (work that almost feels like a hobby project), one about [MagiKarp](https://github.com/harisont/magikarp) (hobby project that almost feels like work).
They are both light-hearted and _riddled_ with inside jokes because, especially after yesterday's meeting, I'm tired of taking myself seriously this semester (and if _I_ am tired of myself, imagine my colleagues).

__Listening to__: Ymna women's choir (another live xmas concert).

## Day 13: hmm...
This morning I finished reading issue number 9 of _hmm_, my [DIY digital magazine](https://harisont.github.io/2025/11/30/hmm.html) ("hmm" stands for "harisont's multilingual magazine").
I spent some time going through my highlights and bookmarks from the ebook, which led to some further exploration of the WWW and [a new [a] in the [[[a]]]](../lists/rss.md), posted about the two most interesting reads [on Mastodon](https://mstdn.social/@harisont/115713480985646886) and prepared the next issue.

I also revamped my RetroPie to play some Tetris with a friend and accidentally ended up with a massively improved setup for my Raspberry Pi (which I mostly use as a media player); details and photos tomorrow.

__Listening to__: political news podcasts in various languages - [El Hilo (es)](https://elhilo.audio/), [Limes (it)](https://www.limesonline.com/audio/serie/limes---il-podcast-di-geopolitica-18453170/), [Europapodden (sv)](https://www.sverigesradio.se/europapodden) (all of them have normal RSS-or-similar feeds and can be listened to via brilliant FOSS apps like [AntennaPod](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.danoeh.antennapod/)).
And then 8-bit music. 
Lots of 8-bit music.

## Day 14: Raspberry fields forever
So, as I touched upon yesterday, I have a Raspberry Pi that I occasionally use for watching videos on my projector, playing ~~games~~ Tetris and (even more occasionally) listening to the music I still have in a hard drive from the pre-streaming times.

I don't like video games a lot, but I do enjoy watching movies (as well as other long-form videos) at home.
The reason why I only do that sporadically is that my system is a huge mess of wires and peripherals, so impractical to set up that I have to plan for it in advance and so ugly that I always want to disassemble everything as soon as the movie is over.
As for music, which I listen to on a daily basis, it goes without saying that streaming stuff with Spotify on my phone is orders of magnitude more convenient than maintaining my own music library and dealing with LibreElec/Kodi (the impressive, yet incredibly frustrating software I use on the Pi) to play it. 

Ever since I decided to stoppify (and, in general, to take a step back from music streaming subscriptions at least temporarily), I thought I might give Kodi another chance.
Plus, I recently discovered [PlayOnDlna](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/io.github.scovillo.playondlna/), an awesome Android app to stream YouTube videos to Kodi.
Combined with [LibreTube](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.libretube/), it convinced me to finally get rid of my Chromecast and use the Raspberry Pi more. 
However, the Mighty Jungle of Cables issue persisted.

Yesterday, I finally realized that, on top of the Raspberry Pi itself, I _also_ have a beautiful, odd, solid wood box my aunt gave me as a birthday present last year.
The reason why the box looks interesting is that it used to contain a field telephone, and the fact that it contained a field telephone means it has an abundance of differently shaped _holes_ in all the right spots... you know where this is going, right?
I call it the Field Raspberry.

{% include image.html file="../assets/img/das/rasperry_field_out.JPG" description="The outside of the Field Rasperry." %}

{% include image.html file="../assets/img/das/rasperry_field_in.JPG" description="The inside of the Field Rasperry. In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the hard drive (as well as the Pi itself) sleeps tonight." %}

The inside is still a mess, but I already love how this thing is turning out.

Today I worked on the software side of things.
Not in the sense of _writing_ any software, but as in configuring LibreElec/Kodi.
I imported my old music library and movies, installed a couple web radio plugins, got the analog audio to work reliably (it was just a matter of uncommenting a couple lines in a config file, but good luck finding the config file) and set everything up so that I can remote control Kodi from my phone (with the [Kore](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.xbmc.kore/) app). 
This means that, when the Field Raspberry is not connected to a screen or projector (which is most of the time), I can use my phone to play music.

I will happily do that for the rest of the evening while I read through one of my students' project report draft.

__Listening to__: random stuff from my outdated digital music library.

## Day 15: tired enough to look up games
After a short night's sleep and a long work day, the only thing I could bring myself to do was to tidy up my RetroPie library, deleting a bunch games I hate and adding a few new ones to try out. 
The latter is kind of pointless, because as much as I enjoy testing games every now and then, they never keep me entertained for more than a few hours (with very, very few notable exceptions).
Also, I didn't get the one I was most curious about, Captain Blood, to run.
