The [December Adventure](https://eli.li/december-adventure) is a chill alternative to the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), which is exactly what I need in December: the darkness of this month prompts me to spend even more time on my computer, and my goal is to spend at least some of that time every day doing something I'm excited about. 
Doesn’t even really have to be code, as the person behind the initiative says.

## Day 1: plans
Textbook Monday around here, which leaves little room for adventure besides setting up this log.
For the first few days of the month, I'll be focusing on [wytiwys](https://github.com/harisont/wytiwys/), a programming project that is technically work but also very out of the ordinary (as well as of my comfort zone) and therefore kind of fun.
The enjoyment I often find in my job blurs the line between work and play, but I hope to soon make time for my hobby projects too.
I won't necessarily start anything new and big. 
The plan is rather to do some pleasurable software maintenance, add some new features to my everyday tools, write one or two blog posts and perhaps work on some long-term photography projects.
